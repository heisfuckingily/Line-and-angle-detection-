# Line-and-angle-detection-
Here is a possible description in English for your project:

This project recognizes black lines and measures their angles using Python. It can be useful for measuring angles in images and detecting lines of specific orientations. The code uses Python's OpenCV library to detect edges in images and calculate Hough lines. It then analyzes the lines to find black lines and measure their angles. This simple line and angle detection algorithm can be improved and expanded to be useful for applications such as robot vision, quality inspection, and image analysis. The project is published on GitHub and is open source for anyone to learn from and extend further.
